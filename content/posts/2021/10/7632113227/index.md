Hopped in a cab at 04:30 am and head to Animeshs' to catch-up over a shortish bike ride. Some great off-road mountain biking through the Mrigavani WIldlife Park led us to a lesser known beautiful spot overlooking the Osman Sagar lake. Been a while that I've done some good mountain biking and looks like I badly needed this get-away!
