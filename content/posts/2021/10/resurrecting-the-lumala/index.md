title: Resurrecting the Lumala
---

In a freak case of serendipity and perfect coincidence, I got to know earlier this week that my first owned geared bike was still very much standing in dusty glory in my Aunt's garage. I bought the Lumala back in 2009 and it's taken me several hundreds of miles on the western ghats. So many good memories!

Spent a good chunk of my free time during last week to revive it and I think I'm almost there!
