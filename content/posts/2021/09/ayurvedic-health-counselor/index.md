title: Ayurvedic Health Counselor
---

Meena is now a certified Ayurvedic Health Counselor! So super duper proud of her. The last year has been rough and being on a different timezone from the rest of the class didn't help either. Nevertheless, she powered through those classes and we already see her applying her invaluable knowledge for folks within the family. Counseling is something that comes naturally to her and I can't wait to see how she applies the nuanced learnings of this fascinating science to help more people tend to the source of their health issues.
