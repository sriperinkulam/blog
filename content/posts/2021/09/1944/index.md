Found this 77 year old coin amidst some old papers. Several years ago I also did find a small collection of stamps which I [digitized a few years](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/08/26/stamp-collection-digitized/) ago. Someone in the family definitely shared this interest in coins and stamps. Oddly, Appa doesn't recollect saving these!
