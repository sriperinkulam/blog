title: State of The Networks â€“ Sep 2021
---

Over the last few months, I was able to take some time to explore a few self-hostable options. I got to explore [caddy](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/28/caddy-through-the-tunnel/) (Which is terrific by the way!), setup [guacamole](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/15/guacamole-clientless-remote-desktop-access/) and I'm also absolutely loving [Navidrome](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/28/july-27-2021-2105/). I got rid of OSMC since we weren't quite using it as much and setup pi-hole to block ads network wide. With these changes, I think I am able to put these devices to real good use. While at it, I also setup a WireGuard tunnel from a VPS to access my local devices securely outside my home network.

Since my [February update](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/02/05/state-of-the-networks-feb-2021/), I haven't changed the services on the cloud much. I did get rid of Bookstack, Known and Signal-CLI since I wasn't using them as much. I am however using [Trilium notes](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/?s=trilium) exhaustively as my go-to notes and knowledge-base application.
