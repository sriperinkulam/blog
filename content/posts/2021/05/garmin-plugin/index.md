Tweaked this setup further to make it a bit more seamless. I used a different but more reliable script to fetch the activity json files and setup a cron job to run twice every week. Next-up: 01. Make the parsing and data display theme agnostic. 02. Add a quick link to publish individual activities as posts if required 03. Build some cool charts :)
