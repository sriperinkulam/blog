I've been struggling over the last year and a half to get back to a proper workout regimen that I like. Wanted ashtanga to be a part of it since that's the only yoga practice I find exciting. Good to be back in the zone today. Did just the standing poses.

Ashtanga Standing : ðŸ§˜ Ashtanga for 00:35:00 Calories : 120

Also testing out my garmin plugin! :)
