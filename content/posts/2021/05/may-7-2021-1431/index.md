Earlier this week, I came across this [nifty python tool](https://pypi.org/project/garminexport/) that lets you backup all your garmin data from the Garmin-Connect platform. I wrote a crude WordPress plugin to parse the json files over and display the data on my website [here](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/). The tool is kind of unstable because it essentially 'mimics' a regular Garmin-connect login and download. Also probably the reason why there aren't many functional plugins for Garmin on wordpress.

Should be reasonably straightforward to automate this with a cron job once I sort out the connection issues with Garmin. Also for now, I'm just posting all the activities to a single page. Might be interesting to create short posts for new activities and obviously filter them out from the RSS Feeds. Love these teeny tiny coding projects!
