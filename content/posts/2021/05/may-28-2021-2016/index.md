It just struck me today how much I love writing crude, rewarding code. The type that is just sufficient to get the job done and that which 'scratches your itch' and might probably be useful for someone else too.

I am not a software developer. Never been one. My day job is far, far from it. It's been more than a decade that I've worked in a software firm. And even when I did, a good bunch of my time then was spent of mainframe code \[Rexx / JCL\] and Change Management.

All code that I write today is self-taught. Which is probably why it's crude? But beautiful it is, because it challenges me to think of logic first and semantics next. It pushes me to find the quickest way possible because I know exactly what I want it to do. And most importantly it keeps my mind fired and active!
