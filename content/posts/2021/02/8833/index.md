Met a couple friends and their familes on a short hike up the Pallavaram hills. Was good catching up after a while! Despite temperature being in the high 80s, the kids had a terrific time.

On the organizing front though, I could have done better. We initially planned to meet at 10:00 but ended up climbing around 11:30 due to travel delays. I wasn't carrying my first-aid kit and the usual pick-me-up edibles/tailwind. I missed checking on everybody's general health condition prior to the climb. Had the trail been a few more miles longer, with the rising temps, things could have escalated pretty quickly...

Well, thankfully all went well. Time to get back into those planning shoes and dust off my hike leaders hat.
