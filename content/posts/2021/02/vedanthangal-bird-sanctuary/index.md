title: Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary
---

We did a quick 2 hour road trip down to the [Bird Sanctuary in Chengalpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanthangal_Bird_Sanctuary) this Monday. The location and the sanctuary design - amidst tall trees, lush green fields and a vast water body; really set the stage for a fabulous viewing experience. We obviously got to see a ton of migratory birds. Sparky clean surroundings and facilities, and the very knowledgeable 'spot' person on the viewing tower made this quite a wholesome trip.

Shasta had her 'moments' but did enjoy the outing. We hit some traffic on the way back but nothing too crazy. I see more local road trips happening soon!
