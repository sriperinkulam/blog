title: The Adyar river trail
---

It's so hard to find long dirt trails here in Chennai. So when I heard about the Adyar river trail, I hopped on the bike and head over across the city. Thoroughly enjoyed the 6kms of solidarity amidst this bustling city. Got Shasta and Meena over this weekend and they had their bit of nature-fix too.

I need to actively scout for these secluded nature spaces. They come far and few but I'm pretty sure there's got to be more!
