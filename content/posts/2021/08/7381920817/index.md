Great weather! Plan was to head towards Kovalam, spend about 4 hours outdoors and see what my endurance baseline was. Turned around at Sholinganallur since I had to use the restroom. This is something I need to plan for while in India. The lack of good public restrooms / porta porties is a huge detriment.

So glad I decided to head via OMR. The wider road along with the service road definitely made it feel safer.
