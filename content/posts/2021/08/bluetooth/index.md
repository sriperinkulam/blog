The Bluetooth on my NUC stopped working after an apt upgrade last evening. A good chunk of troubleshooting did no help. My initial hunch was that this was caused by the kernel upgrade. Reverting didn't help though. I finally caved in and ordered a USB<>Audio adapter. This morning, It struck me that this could be due to the BIOS which I haven't updated in a while. And I was spot on! Now I have a pretty functional Bluetooth system, an up-to-date machine and yet another adapter which goes into my mystery black-box.
