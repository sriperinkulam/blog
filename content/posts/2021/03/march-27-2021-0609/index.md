[@tnpoliceoffl](https://twitter.com/tnpoliceoffl) What would it take for you to legalize or make it mandatory for all ambulances to drive on the opposite direction of traffic flow? I've seen this in Uganda and it's amazing how swift they're able to beat the traffic. Oncoming traffic has no option but to make way.
