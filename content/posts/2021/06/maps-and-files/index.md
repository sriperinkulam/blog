@ndanes@smallcamp.art I've had absolutely zero issues using \[nextcloudpi\](https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/#supported\_systems). Silently been chugging along for a few years now with auto-updates and close to zero manual intervention. For the maps alternative, I've had my eyes on \[Magic earth\](https://www.magicearth.com/)
