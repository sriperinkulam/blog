While walking someone through a few features of Trilium notes, I realized the Trilium notes electron app is really good! Besides the offline-first feature it provides, it also lets me have an additional backup of the notes. And then I also figured, I did have to tweak the volume configuration in my yaml a bit for the data to be persistent!
