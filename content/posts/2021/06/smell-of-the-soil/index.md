Just published Appa's first book - 'Smell of the Soil' in print format. This has been on his (and my) 'to-do' list for a while now. We did publish the digital version in December 2017 and looking back makes me wonder why we didn't publish the print version earlier!

It's been a few years that he's been wanting to do this and we've had quite some discussion on what's the best way to publish/market and never quite came to a consensus. Today, on an impulse, I hit the publish button with a small publishing firm in India and ordered the first copy for myself. Can't wait to get my hands on it and send him a copy!
