Ouch! After a [good](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/06/13/maps-and-files/) [couple](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/04/19/april-19-2021-2342/) years of unhindered access, I've lost (remote) access to my RPI server. I'm guessing an auto upgrade might have disabled wireguard or flushed theÂ  ip table rules. I should have had a secondary connection to the remote network since I did anticipate this happening sometime! Well, until I have physical access to the server, I'll have to bank on my cold flash drive backups! So glad I have multiple accessible copies of the data files!
