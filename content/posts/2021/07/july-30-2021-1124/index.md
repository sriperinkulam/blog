Not sure how I came across this, but I'm so glad I did bookmark it to watch-later. A beautiful film with terrific snow mountain videography and kids!

Having Shasta probably makes me appreciate this a lot more. Meena and I started taking Shasta out on hikes since she was about 3 weeks old. We expose her to sharp tools and fire under close supervision. I still think there's so much more we could do with her once we overcome our fear of exposing her to the elements. And this video was a much needed terrific reminder of how short we were falling on that metric!
