Meena video interviewed my dad this weekend. The intent was to document his thoughts and perspectives of the years gone by and to get glimpses of his generation. We learnt so many interesting things about our family that we wouldn't have known if we hadn't done this. An oral history of sorts! This has been on the back burner for a while now and I'm so glad we got this rolling! This along with the family tree project has sent me down the rabbit hole of documenting our ancestral history.
