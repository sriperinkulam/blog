I continue to be amazed at how hassle-free my Nextcloud setup on the RPi3 is! With automated upgrades on the NextxloudPi, I've barely had to login to the backend for maintenance. This has been my only file server since 2017 and the best 'tech' investment so far! There's absolutely no reason why anyone should be saving their photos/data on someone else's machine these days!
