Switched over to consuming Twitter via RSS feeds. For now I am using Yarns on WP to collect the feeds and the Indigenous app / Monocle-web social reader to read/interact with tweets. With this setup, I get to stay clear of the tracking and ads \[Last time I checked uBlock Origin blocked 90 trackers/ads in 3 minutes!\] and more importantly use my website as the primary place where I post. While I am not quite active on twitter, this should be a great go-between to reconnect with folks who use it for their primary digital presence.
