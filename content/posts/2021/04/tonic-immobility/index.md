title: Tonic Immobility

Overheard at NatGeo recently produced a great podcast on Orcas and I learnt about [Tonic Immobility](https://www.sharktrust.org/tonic-immobility).

Shasta was watching [Octonauts](http://www.octonauts.com/) and guess which episode she ends up watching? - The one in which they talk about TI. Now that's some coincidence!
