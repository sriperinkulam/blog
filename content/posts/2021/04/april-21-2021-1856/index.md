Watched [_My Octopus Teacher_](https://bag.srkn.org/share/60807589c3bfc4.76148451) earlier this week. Some stunning underwater visuals and quite a fascinating documentary. Also reminded me of the terrific [_Octomom_](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/weeknote-20-trails-and-switches/#octomom) podcast from Radiolab last year.
