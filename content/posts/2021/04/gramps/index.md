Meena's been interested in building our family tree for a while now. Installed Gramps on her machine and she's feeding this nifty application with all the family data. This is going to be an extended project and can't wait to see what comes out of it. Haven't researched much but looks like Gramps does not have a shared/collaborative edit features. It does have good export features, so should be easy to move data around to other applications if needed.
