title: Screenshare using Signal
---

I was tweaking my [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) settings earlier this morning and [noticed I could install a virtual camera](https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions#ubuntumint-installation) on my machine. Once this add-on is installed and activated, it essentially exposes OBS studio 'scenes' as an input that any conferencing software could use instead of the webcam feed. This effectively translates to sharing your screen with other participants on the conference call!

Ever since I deleted my whatsapp account and [moved over to using Signal](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/01/10/digital-reset/) as my primary communication tool, this is one feature I wish the Signal app had. And now, I could use this neat little trick not just with Signal but any conferencing app that doesn't let me share my screen in their free-tier!
