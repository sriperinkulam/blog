title: License and Global Warming!
---

I've been using the WordWeb Dictionary for almost two years now. Well, this is an application which gives you the meaning of almost any English word that you ping in ( a bit of an exaggeration, but believe me, It's extremely good! :-) )

Coming to the main part now, I happened to install a newer version of it a month back. Yesterday, when I opened the application a message popped up telling me that my trial version had expired. Hey, but this was not any common license validation request that one generally comes across! I've paraphrased their statement here. Couldn't help controlling my laughter having read the clause! :-)

...................................................................................................................

_**Free version licence**_

_You have just crossed the 30 day trial period. WordWeb may be freely used only by people who meet the conditions below._

_You may use the program free of charge indefinitely only if_

- _You take at most 4 flights (2 return flights) in any 12 month period_
- _AND you do not own or regularly drive an SUV (sports utility vehicle)._

_If you do not qualify you must uninstall the program after the 30-day trial period or purchase [WordWeb Pro](http://wordweb.info/). The licence is designed to provide a small incentive for people with massively unsustainable emissions to cut down._

_Whenever a user no longer meets the above requirements, and they have installed the product for more than 30 days, they must uninstall the product or purchase WordWeb Pro; otherwise it is software theft._

_There are two exceptions to the above: not-for-profit educational establishments may install WordWeb for the use of their students (regardless of whether their students meet the "sustainable user" requirement), and the registered disabled who require an SUV for transport may use the program freely if they take at most four flights per year._

...................................................................................................................

Well, both the clauses do not apply to me and I continue to use the application without any licensing done :-) . Nevertheless, it did drive the point home regarding Global warming at least for a few moments!
