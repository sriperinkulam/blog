title: Fedora 7
---

The OSS and Red Hat community have launched their latest OS. Parting from their age old nomenclature, they now prefer to call it Fedora 7 and not Fedora Core 7. It's available for download [here.](http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora.html "Here")

For those of you people with access to snail paced connectivity to the internet, there's a provision to request for a free DVD. The Community releases only 200 free DVD's a month in a given region. So if you're pretty much interested in having a DVD for yourself, act fast [here](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Distribution/FreeMedia "Here").The request form purportedly, is going to be available only at around 1pm July 2nd PST, so that's around 1:30 am July 3rd IST.

Unlike other free distributions, the package will be posted to your address from India, so it should reach you in a couple of days :-) . Eagerly looking forward to lay my hands on it !
