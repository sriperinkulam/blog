There's been this song that i'd come across a few days back. Pretty good one ...Composed for the eradication of poverty and for Millennium Development Goals campaign by UN by rahman..Do have a peek at it in Youtube

Composed by A.R.Rahman Lyrics by Blaaze Singers: A.R.Rahman and Blaaze

Lyrics:

Pray for me brother Pray for me brother Pray for me sister Are you searchin’…. Pray for me brother

Lookin’ for the answers To all the questions In my life Will I be alone Will you be there By my side Is it something he said Is it something he did I wonder why He is searchin’ For the answers To stay alive

Could you ever listen Could you ever care To speak your mind Only for a minute For only one moment In time

The joy is around us But show me the love That we must find Are you searchin’ For a reason to be kind, to be kind… He said… Pray for me brother

Pray for me brother Pray for me sister Pray for me brother Say what you wanna say now But keep your hearts open Be what you wanna be now Let’s heal the confusion Pray for me brother

Don’t let me take When you don’t wanna give Don’t be afraid Just let me live Don’t let me take When you don’t wanna give Don’t be afraid Say what you wanna say now But keep your hearts open

Be what you wanna be now Let’s heal the confusion Pray for me brother Pray for me brother I’m ashamed ah, brother be dying of poverty when he down on his knees its only then he prays And it’s a shame ah, brother be dying of ignorance cos the world is a trip and everybody’s a hypocrite Need to stop ah , taking a look at the other I’m not ashamed of poverty need to be making his life better So think about it, think about it once more cos life is a blessing and it’s not justa show, ah Round and round the world is spinning around

We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now Round and round the world is turning around We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith We need to coming together just to win this race

Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith We need to coming together just to win this race (twice) Are you searching for a reason to be kind ?
