title: Coding...
---

It's about 7:00 pm now on aÂ saturday evening. Got to submit a demo project which carries a bulk of my grading weightage. Sitting right here for the past 10 hrs. There's a lot of coding still left to be done and here I am sulking to the lowest possible position on my seat and banging the keyboard typing this stuff.

I've been trying to find that silly dumb bug that I've incorporated in my code unknowingly, for the past three hours and still I see no light anywhere. Everything seems perfect, but still things don't work the way I want them to work! The Pointer gets referenced haphazardly, the loop jerks out in a wierd fashion, the output screen beeps but still does nothing much such that I can claim to have surpassed an error. Logical errors...Link errors ...Grrr!!

Wish things were better! :(
