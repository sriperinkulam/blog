title: The girl by the window!
---

I leave home by around 7am to work by bus everyday. It's about an hours drive from my place and I tend to calculate how early or how late I am based on the relative presence or occurrence of other regular happenings around me. The bus gets to the outskirts by crossing a few posh areas in the city so it's quite common to see International school buses drive past you. There's this particular bus that I get to notice almost everyday about 100 yards from the Hitec city building. It's not the bus that catches my attention. It's a girl sitting by the third window in the bus.

The first day I notice her she's on a call with someone. The second day I see her, she's still with that sleek jazzy cell phone. I unfortunately doze the next two days. Yesterday I managed to wake just in time and boy what do i see! She's again busy talking with someone. Now, I really start wondering what's wrong with her. All the Kids in the bus are hopping around. She's the only female who's dwelling in her own world. She's probably just in her tenth. I'm least bothered whom she's talking to but then something definitely seems to be out of place. Even before I get a good look at her, the bus zips across. Today morning I try staying awake just to have that quick look at her. This time it so happens that both our buses move in sync, I afford a quick turn to my left at the right moment and look ahead. It is then that something registers in my mind. Wait! Something is really wrong! I turn to my left again and observe a bit more keenly. Painting!!! That was a damn art work on the third window! 8O

It wasn't a girl after all. Just one wholesome, beautiful, artistic work of someone really skilled! I still have no clue why an International school bus should have an artwork of a girl, that too with a cellphone on just one of it's windows. It did keep me smiling all day through though! :-)
