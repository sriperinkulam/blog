Yipee...Just finished the POST.That literally means the techie part of my training is done with!!Got just a few Management sessions for the next few days till our postings get decided and then I'm no more a trainee! Finally, a sense of completion after a gruelling four month hectic schedule. 

 I'm least bothered on how tough things are going to get post the POST :-) !! The past four months have shown me glimpses of a techie life and I laaauv expecting the unexpected!! So who cares! :-)
