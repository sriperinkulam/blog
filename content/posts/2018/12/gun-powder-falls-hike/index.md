title: Gun Powder Falls Hike
---

Had my eyes on this trial ever since I saw the 'Gun powder falls state park' sign on I95. Drove over for about 30mins with Sharath to get here this afternoon.

Pretty surprised not to find many folks on this trail. The weather was just right and this short 5 mile round trip hike was precisely what we needed to close out 2018. The short stream crossing at the end of the trail was an added bonus!
