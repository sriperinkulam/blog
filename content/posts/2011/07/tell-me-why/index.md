title: Tell me why...
---

Was stumped by this innocent letter from a kid in my class. Yukta - One of the smartest kids, questions me\[ In RED and gives place for me to answer!\] on how I came across the idea of playing the Age of Empires game!

In this game that we play in the class, she happens to be the 'Queen' with the most notorious 'subjects'. Guess she just wanted to vent all her frustration\[?\] through this letter.
