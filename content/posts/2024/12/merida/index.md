Back from a productive work trip in Merida. Overall, I think it went great. Most of the planning over the last few months paid off and but for a few minor issues, we were able top wrap up coring the NCC in about three days. 

Also found a few fantastic food options through the week. For lunch we mostly had to do an Uber eats since there weren't many options around the new consulate. [Habaneros](https://habaneros.com.mx/) was the find of the week though. Their *Pimitos* was on point!

This would most likely be my last work-trip to Merida. Time for some transition planning to hand the baton over.{{< permalink >}}
