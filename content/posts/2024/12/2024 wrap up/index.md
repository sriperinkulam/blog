### JAN
- Hiked up Izta via [La Joya](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/01/28/la-joya-izta-volcan-hike/).
- Quick work trip to Monterrey. Loved that those hills are right there in the city! Next time I'm back here, I should plan to get here around a weekend. Food was great. Traffic was meh. Would strongly consider bidding for a position here - if/when one opens up!
- M,S & S went to Oaxaca. They loved it!

### FEB
- Work travels took me to Merida and Managua. Managua had the vibes of any second tier southern Indian city. 
- Anton's [Whiskey tasting](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/02/05/prieto-y-prieta/) was uber fun! 
- Girl scouts hike to Desierto Leones. Mike led the group. Was good to take a step back and be just a regular participant!
- Piedra Herrada Monarch butterfly trip. Barely got to spot any Monarchs. Looks like they made their way up north a bit sooner this year.

### MAR
- Aparna and Vuday visit us for a few days. Joined them on the [hot air balloon up the Teotihuacan Pyramids](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/04/globo-aerost%C3%A1tico/). Such a cool experience!
- Back in Managua for a longish trip. Those wire pulls were painful but so much fun!
- M & S went to Las Estacas for the Girl Scouts Camping trip. Missed being there with them.
- We took our R&R in Maui for about a week. So much fun being in the water! But boy, oh so pricey! [Haleakala](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/03/leleiwi-overlook-trail/) was neat. [Missed the whales](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/06/maui-whales/) though!

### APR
- [Hallucinations up on the Izta](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/12/izta-attempt/) were surreal.

- Jothi patti and the Wierer's visited us for a week.
- The [Nevado de toluca](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/23/nevado-de-toluca/) hike would probably be one of the highlights of our Mexico posting!
- Hiked up [Pico de aguila cerro cruz](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-%C3%A1guila/). The descent was - oh so painful - but super fun!
