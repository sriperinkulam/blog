A recent [podcast from 99% invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/603-the-memory-palace-book/) nudged me to get Nate DiMeo's book - [The Memory Palace](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-memory-palace-true-short-stories-of-the-past-nate-dimeo/21177599?ean=9780593446157). I've always loved the Memory Palace podcast. Super intrigued to see how Nate carries over the suspense in written form. {{< permalink >}}
