Most of my free time over the last few days has been spent trying to implement the comments section on this site. Something that would have been super straightforward on a regular CMS is not quite so for a static site. Initially I tinkered with the idea of side-loading the comments feature over to the fediverse. It worked okay but it did feel quite choppy. 

Looking around a bit, I decided to give [ISSO](https://isso-comments.de/) a chance. It seemed to have all the features I was looking for and was reasonably easy to setup. As with most things tech though, I had quite some difficulty tweaking it to work the way I wanted it to. Taking a break and getting back to it after a few days, did get me to approach this from a different perspective and I think it's super close to where I'd like it to be. 

On certain things, I am perfectly okay leaving things half baked and cutting my losses. On most things though, I do like seeing things to closure. There's so much thrill in figuring out why something is not working the way it is supposed to. Most often it's because of something ridiculously silly or because of minor oversights. Trials and tribulations of the last mile closures, I guess?

For now, this site has a basic commenting system and that gives me enough momentum to pursue other things to tweak. {{< permalink >}}
