Ordered a Kobo Clara BW for M on a whim. Been a while that I've surprised her! Twelve years ago when I gifted her the Kindle she was initially super upset - we barely had any money then. This time around when she opened it, her reaction was neutral at best. 

Setting it up wasn't quite intuitive. Took me 20 minutes to figure out that the software wasn't showing the option for overdrive sync because it sensed our location to be outside US/Canada. An easy fix until we hit the next issue - M only has a Libby account and that does not map 1:1 to an Overdrive account. Looks like I'll have to setup an overdrive account now, add all her library cards and then sync that account in the Kobo. Reasonable ask I guess. But doesn't really help my case of getting her to try off mainstream devices.
