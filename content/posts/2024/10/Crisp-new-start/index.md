Since 2007, WordPress has been home to most of my digital presence. Sometime last week one of the plugins – Wordfence, I think – took a major dump and nuked my site down. Didn't quite see that coming but I take that as a sign for me to change things up a bit. I've been wanting to test out WriteFreely for a while now and this might be just about the right opportunity. I'm not quite suew how I want to handle the migration. For now though, it's a brand new shiny slate.
