Last weekend I got a bit cocky and decided to upgrade the distro on the NextcloudPi. The upgrade seemed to go well until it threw a PHP error which got me going in circles. In hindsight, I'd setup automatic upgrades on NextcloudPi and Nextcloud, which seems to have conflicted with the actual distribution's update. Now I did take a backup, but that didn't quite sit well with the now upgraded system and the myriad PHP issues.

Had enough of the band-aid fixes and decided to migrate the nextcloud server to a laptop that was just lying around unused. Decided to stick with the [NexcloudPi OS](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/) since it has served me super awesome over the last seven years. I did make sure the auto upgrades were disabled though! Also RSync is awesome!

An addedÂ  bonus is that I now have a spare RPi3 to tinker with! Not quite [dumbing down](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-aguila/), am I?
