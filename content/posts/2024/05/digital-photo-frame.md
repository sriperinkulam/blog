title: Digital Photo frame
year: 2024
---

Used the spare RPI3 I salvaged from the [NCP migration](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/posts/2024/05/nextcloudpi/) and made a decent digital photo frame. Ever since I consolidated all my photos, I’ve been wanting to setup a digital frame that would take us back in time on command. Some version of ‘On this day’ – but for photos. I think I have a solution that is close to what I had in mind. The photos are currently on a USB drive synced from my Nextcloud server via a cron job. I still need to work out how I choose what photos get displayed when. But so far, I am pretty happy with how this has turned out.
