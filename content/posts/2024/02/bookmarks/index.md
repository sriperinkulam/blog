Setup a [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) instance on the Moose for better managing my bookmarks. Not a huge fan of the name but it's a great lightweight app doing just what it's built for.

The [HTTP Shortcuts](https://github.com/Waboodoo/HTTP-Shortcuts) app on FDroid is a decent partner app to share bookmarks from the phone.
