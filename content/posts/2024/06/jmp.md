Been looking for a Google voice number replacement for sometime now and looks like I might have found one that meets most of my needs. Just got a [JMP number](https://jmp.chat/) and ordered a sim with a data plan. The cheogram app so far has been great and once I get the SIM I might slowly transition things out of GV.
