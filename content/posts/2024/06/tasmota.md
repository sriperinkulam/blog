Wanting to have more control on the [Digital Photo Frame](http://0.0.0.0:8123/2024/05/23/digital-photo-frame/) that I setup a few days ago, I ordered a few [Sonoff smart plugs](https://sonoff.tech/product/smart-plugs/s31-s31lite/). Right after I ordered them I realised I could actually flash Tasmota on them to keep them cloud-free. Ordered a couple FTDI USB adapters to flash Tasmota on them. Time to dust off that soldering gun!
