Brought the Grand Vitara home today. We’d been on the lookout for a decent car ever since we knew about our next posting. We don’t need one here in CDMX but would definitely need one in Yaounde. All I wanted was a reliable bare minimum car with no gadgetry shabangs. Over the last few months folks on their PCS did post a few decent cars but these are barely in the market for a few hours. With this one though, the stars seemed to align all well one day and we were able to seal the deal in a few hours.

Given the mileage, the GV might need some maintenance over the next few years. It rides like butter now though and reminds me of the [Grand Cherokee](http://0.0.0.0:8123/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/) we had in NYC/BOS.
