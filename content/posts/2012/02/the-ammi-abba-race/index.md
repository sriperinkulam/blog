title: The Ammi-Abba race
---

Most of this term, we've been making a conscious effort to get the kids down to the playground and smell some dust. Early this month as we were trying to infuse the elements of team work in them, we decided to get them to do the 'Amoeba race'. After a brief description of 'Amoeba' we got the kids down to the ground and flagged the race.

Later the next day, when asked to recollect the name- One kid pops up and innocently transliterates it as Ammi Abba!
