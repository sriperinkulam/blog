It all started when I realized, I was not a normal human . And this was when people started commenting on my walking pace and talking pace. I never spoke slowly and never walked slowly. Over time I've controlled my talking pace but when it came to physical mobility; it's only increased over time!

At Bangalore, sometime during the end of July 2007, I was sifting through a few internal pages in my company's intranet portal and happened to come across this site that claimed to be a web portal of an adventure group. I registered just for the heck of it in their google groups. Every other week I ended getting a mailer from the group informing about one trek or the other. But then, I never cared. My friends circle was least interested in any outdoor activity. It was just Volleyball, Basketball, TT and Swimming. So be it.

Four months later, soon after I headed back to Hyderabad over just another lousy week; I happened to read a mail from the AdVentura team. It was about a Parasailing event that was being organized in Hoskote. Impulsively, I gave Suma a call and got myself registered. Given the short time span, I couldn't arrange for tickets to Bangalore. As a last resort I went down to the Bus terminus and by sheer luck managed to get a ticket in the APSRTC inter-state transport bus. That weekend changed my perspective towards life. Up there in the air about 450m high, I decided I'd live like I've never lived before. Back on the ground, I promised Suma that Iâ€™d help her start a club in Hyderabad. Finally on 6th Feb 2008, Hyderabad had its own Adventure club - HydVentura.

On 27th March 2007, when I was transferred to Pune. I was on cloud nine. Pune as I knew it then, was a magnificient, young city. Little did I know what was in store for me . Just a week there and I managed to be an integral part of Deccan Highlander - The unofficial Infy Pune Trekking club. Almost every other weekend we've been on treks. The count never mattered. The count could be four, or it could be forty. All that mattered was we stood to the promise of having at least one trek per week.
