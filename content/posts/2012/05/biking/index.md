Way back in my third grade, My brother and I tried learning to ride the BIG bike that one of our cousins had. Afraid that I'd damage the cycle, I was allowed to ride it only under 'parental supervision'. One fateful day my bro forgets locking the bike and leaves for school. I seem to stay back at home for some reason and sometime around 3:00pm in the evening manage to escape out of the house when every one was having their siesta. I stealthily sneak the bike out of the garage and pedal off to glory.

Just when I realize it's time to get back home fearing my bro would be back anytime now, as I take a turn round the corner and as luck would have it, I see him just ahead of me. I still don't understand why I'd foolishly drove in his direction; Instead of turning around and getting back later. A different case all together If I rode discreetly! But the moron in me got anxious and I zoomed past him. A few yards ahead, there was another street cutting across perpendicularly. I suddenly lost all my balance and wham I fell into the gutter! What followed better goes well unwritten.

Cycling is a passion that I've developed of late. Guess it's majorly got to do with substituting my craze for trekking. The Pune DC has a very active cycling club called Thunderbolts. Being a passive member of the club when I was there, the transition from trekking to Cycling made literal sense. I bought myself a cool 21 geared bike for about 7 grand sometime last month. Though I'm yet to fully realize its potential It's truly been a machine that I'm obsessed with!
