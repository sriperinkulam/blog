title: The Ratna Malathi Scholarship
---

Formulated in Nov-2011, the Ratna-Malathi Scholarship is an endeavour to streamline and acknowledge the diligent efforts taken by teachers to incorporate sports, arts and intuitive projects into their curriculum. Through a structured framework this scholarship would provide a robust pathway for classrooms to experiment new practices, develop systemic modules and eventually help progress towards planning and executing a holistic curriculum. The student nominees of this scholarship would be required to participate in a state level talent recognition event which would involve a sports championship, an art challenge and a creativity quest. The scholarship entails a year long, fully aided sports or arts workshop of the finalists choice besides a three-fourth fee waiver for the next academic year.

Envisioned by Srikanth Perinkuiam and Kavitha BS, this scholarship is a fallout of two years of their experience teaching in a low income private school in Pune. Witness to the impact that sports and arts could bring in to todays' mainstream education, this is an effort to replicate their learnings across classrooms. Since this is just the first year of its incorporation, the scholarship is currently applicable only to Grade2 and Grade3 classrooms in Pune. This was decided primarily on the fact that these grades currently do not have any scholarship schemes or pathways to opportunities. By providing participating classrooms a platform to share and learn from each others best practices, they hope one day all classrooms provide equal opportunities for every kid to excel in what s/he is truly passionate about.
