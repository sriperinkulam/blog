Staying in Hyderabad and not running is a gory crime! I've been a virtual member of the Hyd Runners club for quite sometime now and have finally shred the veil.Though I rarely get to join them, I train alone running on the streets and roads early in the morning or late in the evening.Eventually, I've realised running is such a wonderful means of getting to know your locality!

The 22-Nov Training Cycle

The last one month or so i've been running randomly with no proper plan. From today \[19-Oct-09\] I've started training for the Half Marathon scheduled on 22-Nov-09. Plan to take part in Duathlons soon. Fingers crossed!
