title: Ragnar - Reach the Beach
---

Some great routes all the way down from Bretton woods Ski area in New Hampshire to the Hampton beach. The home stretch was probably the best ragnar finish ever. Despite decent timing, I had a real bad time on my second leg. Not sure if I should attribute it to the training or just how i felt during the run. Probably just one of those 'meh' runs.

Highlight of this event was Sharath and Meena running their first ever Ragnar event. Terrific on the roads and inclines!
