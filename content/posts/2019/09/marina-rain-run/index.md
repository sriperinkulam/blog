A wonderful morning run on the Marina today. Barefoot as always!

With a 'gloomy' weather and not many visitors this early morning, we had most of the beach all for ourselves! As S and I were just about turning around after reaching Ice House, the slight drizzle very soon turned into a full fledged rain. Pouring rain, early morning waves and an empty beach is something I could take in every single day! Shasta seemed to have a terrific time too.

Meena happened to click this picture of us running from the distance. So glad she got around capturing this moment!
