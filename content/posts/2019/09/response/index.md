Rightfully so! There are two beaches with the same name on both coasts of the peninsular region.

The one in Trivandrum is way better than the one I biked to on the east coast. Kerala is bestowed with some really good scenic places. I did a [long backpacking trip](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2010/04/11/17-days/) several years ago. Some of my best memories of exploring that state!
