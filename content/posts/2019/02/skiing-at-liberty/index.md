title: Skiing at Liberty
---

Sneaked in a day at Liberty at the very end of the skiing season. Was so totally worth it!

Meena didn't get around taking the slopes since Shasta was pretty much tethered to her. Kids and I had a blast! Last time we were here \[Dec 2017\] I barely made it down the hill. This time around, I followed Nik's strategy of letting gravity do it's job and maneuvering only when I had to. Totally see how this could be addictive!
