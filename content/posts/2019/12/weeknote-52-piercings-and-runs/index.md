_A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:_

The drive down to Florida was pretty uneventful. But for some holiday traffic near Virginia, we had a pretty smooth drive, clocking about 15 hours in total.

A random talk with a runner at the Baseline trail coaxed us to run a longer distance the next day. Got the four kids and Sharath onboard too. Well, the kids decided to sleep-in on Sunday, while Sharath and I head out to the trail. Realised I didn't carry cash, so we decided to run unsupported. Running conditions were just right with a good blend of drizzle and rain. The beauty of winter is that you can cover so many more miles in the dark! Was mostly helping Sharath pace and finish within 3 hours. Wrapped up with 14.5 miles under his belt. Not a bad way to close out the year!

A week packed with hikes almost every day of the week and a lot of downtime with family. The girls convinced their moms to get extra ear piercings and Nikhil rode the wagon and got one for himself too!

**Interesting reads this week**

[Colleges are turning studentsâ€™ phones into surveillance machines, tracking the locations of hundreds of thousands](https://outline.com/2GhBPn): Thank you, but no thank you! 'Tracking you for your own good' - Isn't that where it all starts going downhill?
