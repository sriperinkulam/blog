**State of the network:** With better access to the router and some re-wiring in the house, I got around rejigging my server setup. This will change once I get my Odroid shipped over. For now though, here's my current setup:

1. 1. [NexcloudPi](https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/) installed on a [Raspberry pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) board
    2. [Diet-Pi](https://dietpi.com/) installed on another Raspberry pi 3B+ board running the pi-hole

The SBCs and the modem are now connected to the UPS inverter, so hopefully that gets rid of the hard shutdowns. Might consider getting a stabilizer at some point in time. I am also leaning towards a more robust homelab system. Yet to whet the core setup and will probably explore that a year down the lane.

**Fitness:** Yet another good week spending time outdoors! A 5k barefoot beach run on Tuesday, 5.5k lap runs at the YMCA on Wednesday, 25mins breaststroke swim at MBC and 30min MAS training at YMCA on Thursday, and a 2k barefoot beach run on Friday.

**Music:** Spent friday evening listening to a Veena instrumental performance at Narada Gana Sabha. A family friend was playing with 107 other artists and I also ran into a college friend with whom I was out of touch for about 10 years now! The performance was a tribute to his grand-father. Small, small world! Below is a shoddy recording of one of the pieces they performed. One of my favorites.

**Interesting tools this week:**

- - If you need to find what other devices are connected to the wifi network that your device is connected to, and a whole lot of other details, the [Fing app](https://www.fing.com/) is wonderful place to start. The free app is pretty slick! I use it to identify IP addresses (and use that to update my pi-hole hosts file for a more human-friendly 'client listing')

**Interesting reads this week:**

- - Google's Sycamore quantum computer apparently achieved [quantum supremacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5813.pdf). John Preskill had a good [article on this on Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/). The next few decades is arguably going to be about computing prowess and the results thereof, and quantum supremacy is a huge move in that direction. Exciting times ahead!
    - Just read this brilliant Nat-Geo piece on [Netherland's sustainable farming practices](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/09/holland-agriculture-sustainable-farming/) and how that's setting them to success as the world's second largest exporters despite being a really small country!
    - An intriguing post on the [Palm oil](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/19/palm-oil-ingredient-biscuits-shampoo-environmental). A cousin who was visiting us last month mentioned how he'd moved away from all packaged foods since they extensively use Palm oil. While I agree with the sentiment of not using packaged food, I wasn't quite aware of the influence of Palm-oil and how deeply ingrained it was in the asian food manufacturing ecosystem till I read this piece from the Guardian.
