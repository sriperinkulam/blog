Philip, You could take practicing your compassion several levels over by driving in Indian traffic. Trust me, I've tried doing what your friend suggested several times and finally chose a better solution - let my wife drive. She's either transcended to zen mode or got way too numbed down with the incessant honking and haphazard, needless lane shifting. And when I really have to drive or am able to get an eye-contact, I've started throwing flying kisses at strangers. It works a charm for that nano-second. Helps me keep calm and drive-on!
