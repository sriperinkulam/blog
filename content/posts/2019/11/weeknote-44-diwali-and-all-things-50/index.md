---

_A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:_

With Diwali celebrations over the last weekend, the family moving over to Hyatt for their temporary stay until the government housing falls in place, Patti's return from her holy trip to Israel and Mummyjaan's 50th birthday, the week pretty much swooshed past!

30mins swimming on Monday, Biked 24k on Wednesday, 5K beach run on Saturday and a 4k beach run on Sunday.

**Interesting tools this week:**

- [Delete Facebook](https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB): Deleting your Facebook posts.
- [Walk the distance](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walk-the-distance/id634548793): Walk the Appalachian trail virtually. Now that sounds like a neat idea instead of just counting steps \[Not that I really subscribe to step counting!\].
- [Tunemymusic](https://www.tunemymusic.com): Transfer playlists between music services!
