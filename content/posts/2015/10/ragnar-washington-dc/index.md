One of most exhilarating (and wet) runs so far. The night run with pitch dark trails and just Joaquin for company made this one unforgettable experience.  Reminded me of the [Katrabai Pass hike](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/adventure-travel/katrabai-pass) back in India.  The Ragnar Appalachians still remains unchecked!
