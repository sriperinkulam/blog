title: The Bear Mountain Half
---

Ran the [#ECSNY Half](https://www.thenorthface.com/get-outdoors/endurance-challenge/new-york.html) at the Bear Mountain State park today! As the stats down under reveal - this was one divine killer run. One of the hardest long-runs I've run so far. My average timing on 'flat-road' half-marathons has been 02:10.  Over the last few weeks as I mentally and physically prepared for this run I was estimating a sub 03:00 finish.

About six miles on the trail I targeted a sub 02:45 finish - But I guess I succumbed to the mountains and then the mind lost to the body in the last 3 or 4 miles. My initial strategy was to hike up the inclines and run down the slopes. Out there, running down the trails was absolutely inevitable and my glutes and calves reminded me of the [innumerable hikes](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/outdoors) done years back in India. A gracious fall by a culvert further slowed me down. I ended with a 03:27 finish. Though these run stats are deplorable even under average standards; I had a truly wonderful time on the trail there.

In hindsight, I believe I need to strongly work on my lower back and do a lot more hill training. Also calls for a lot more hikes to work on the glutes and calves.  Now that the Bear mountain hike is off the list, eye's on the [SRT hike/run](http://srtrunhike.com/) later this year.
