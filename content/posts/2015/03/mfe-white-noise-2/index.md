Of late, I've been having these schizophrenic discussions.  Well, not really but yes - to that effect. The student in me babbles in dead zone while the teacher in me confounds newer variants of possible surprises. Just  15 days to the [third actuarial exam](http://www.beanactuary.org/exams/preliminary/?fa=preliminary-computer-based-exams).

<!--more-->It's not exam-blues, definitely not butterflies in the stomach; probably what it is - is manifestation of deterministic uncertainty  as it gets closer to the 18th. Can't wait to get done with this. At the same time, I don't want to get done with this. The thrill of doing well in these exams is truly rewarding. Probably something that I'd miss once I've earned my credentials. Something to worry about at a later point in time. For now, its back to the mocks and the [Ito's](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/tap/itos-lemma-risk-neutral-pricing "06 Ito’s lemma and Risk-neutral pricing").
