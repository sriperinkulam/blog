The 1.5 hr travel back home in the traffic is taking its toll. It was fine for the first one month, but of late I've realized there's nothing much productive that I'm able to do once I'm back and whatever little I can force myself to, isn't really helping me.

This month seems to be a bit demanding. I've got to pick up on .Net , complete an internal certification and oh yes, there's the french certification exam too. Besides, I've got to avoid sacrificing  my personal time come what may. After all , that's one thing that keeps me motivated :-) .

From yesterday, I've started tuning my body clock.  I get back home by around 9:00 pm , have my dinner by 9:30pm and hit the bed by 10:30.  Morning by around 3:30am I'm all fresh to get up and get things started. And thanks to my motion sensitive grey cells :-) I also get to have a 1hr catnap :-) on the way to office! With no much disturbances that early, my work gets done quickly. Things are working just great and hope it continues :-) .
