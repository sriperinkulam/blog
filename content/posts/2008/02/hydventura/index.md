A day to remember!

We officially launched the Hyderabad Adventure Group - Hydventura today in the Infy Campus :) . This is something that was 'In the pipeline' ;) for quite some time and now after some dilly dallying the group is finally out! We're 70 + now and will soon have our first outing sometime Feb-end or early march. We're planning to expand once we get a foothold in organising outdoor events.

Activities not constrained to Trekking, outdoor survival, Biking, site explorations, Rafting , Rock climbing, Para-sailing would soon be planned. Hydventura would try to do it's little bit in bringing out the importance of outdoor recreational activities and at the same time spread awareness in the public the necessity to keep a check on exploitation of nature.

P.S: Hydventura is a club started by a group of Infoscions in their own interest. The company is no way related to the activities here-in and all activities would more or less be Dutch outings!
