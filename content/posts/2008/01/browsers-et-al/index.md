Of late, browsers are behaving weird on my PC. I've got Firefox and Safari on the system.

Firefox is just not able to handle Wordpress and Safari, in all it's might is trying to remove all the paragraph formatting! The best part is that I'm using a pretty stable version of firefox ( The 2.0.0.11 version). Any leads on what the problem could be? Could it be an issue conflict with a recently installed plugin ?

Anyways, Shall get back to it tomorrow. It's high time I hit bed and leave you contemplating. (That's if at all you are!Â  :) )
