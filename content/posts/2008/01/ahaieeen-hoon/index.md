A 3 month Karate class is going to be held in campus starting Feb 1st.  Given my ambidextrous  flexibility and reflexive fists I would have made a wonderful karate kid ( ahem  ahem ... Professional :-) ). How I wish I could join it ! Had I not payed the 3 grand for my French classes I would have as well been into this. Anyways, gotta see if I can talk with the coach and join a month late. Amends can be made ! :-)
