title: Enduro3!
---

If you've always been wondering that there's something that you've not done for the past few years but just aren't able to figure out what it is, probably I may be able to help you out! ;-)

Pack your bags and get your gear. It's high time you moved from the cozy environs of your home! Ditch that LCD monitor for a couple of days and you'll soon be in better state of affairs!

The National Education Foundation along with the National Egg Co-coordination committee is organizing an All India Adventure Race , called the Enduro3 Adventure race. It's going to be held on the 8th and 9th of Feb at Pune. All you need is hell lots of determination, good strategy and to a certain extent good physical stamina. It's an open competition and anyone can join. Click HERE for registration and other details.

Watchya waiting for? Form your teams, get your cycles and unscrew yourself! ;-)
