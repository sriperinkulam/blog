_Life was ripe and then suddenly it did strike._

_Just a year and a half and all was blown out._

A lot many things to remember and cherish, the rest is now hallucination.

Life still pulls on and people keep talking.

_The vagrant said - I'm alone, The spirit kept saying - No you aren't_

_The vagrant said - People still keep talking, The spirit said - Does it really matter? Keep Smiling!_

Nothing to be done. Nothing that can be done.

They later relented . Phony that it was.

The vagrant said - What's the point? Damage is Done! Keep Smiling

_Seven years! Things have still not changed..._

_Or have they? Never believe a word not from your mouth.._

The spirit still remains, treading parallely with the wanderer.All the way just saying - I'm with you , Keep smiling.

Not a moment of remorse, lest life strikes again!

_Three cheers to the spirit._

_Justice will be done, Keep smiling!_
