It's been a week since this idea conceived in my brain and this weekend I figured out some time to work on it. I've launched another blog in wordpress. But for a change this is something serious. The central idea is to develop an Ad free, simple interface site which could be a one stop site for all the latest happenings in Hyderabad and also serve as a travel guide in the city. I call it the **Hyderabad Simplified Online Project (HSOP) :-)**
