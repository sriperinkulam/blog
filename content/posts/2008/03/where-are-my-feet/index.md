title: Where are my feet?
---

I'm off to B'lore this weekend on a fast paced adventure trip :D . This is going to be HydVentura's second outing, majorly organised by AdVentura folks in collab. with a few other professional groups in Bang. So it's gonna be mighty interesting :-)!

Twenty one of us from the Hyd DC would be reaching Bangalore tomorrow morning, where we'd meet up with ppl from Mysore and Bangalore and move to Hoskote for a Parasailing stint. Once that's done, we'd drive down to Anthargange for cave exploration, Rock climbing , Rappelling and brief treks en-route. In the evening we'd move over to Kalvarhallibetta base for a night camp :-) ! Sunday morning - 1:00am to 4:00am we'd trek up the hill to catch a glimpse of Sunrise at the and then we'd get back to the base and move to Nandi Hills as the final destination before we board the train back to Hyd from Yeshwanthpur. All of this in just two days :-)!

This is the first time, Hydventura folks would be meeting Adventura folks ( The Bang. adventure club) officially before we merge with other similar groups in India ( Pune, Chennai, Mysore, Jaipur, Chandigarh et al) to form one single entity - AdVenturaIndia :-)!

Just hoping, I don't get that expected mail from the HR asking me to report to Pune on Monday ! And, there's also loads of work to get done before EOD :-( .

Wishing for the best! :-)
