title: The Telangana issue
---

A 34 minute video presentation made by the Telangana Development Forum on the issue of a separate state for Telangana. The first twenty minutes doles on the history of the state and the remaining part more or less is a publicity or so called awareness campaign by the TRS.

But how murky is the land on the other side?
