title: Another day down the drain...
---

Got home pretty late yesterday night after a small get together at [Papaji da dhaba.](http://hyderabadjournal.wordpress.com/2008/03/22/papaji-da-dhabha/ "Where is this?") No particular reason as such. Pavan had come to Hyd for a short visit post his training at Satyam- Chennai. Besides, Aditya and I are leaving for Pune this week on a short term transfer. Four of us ( Abi being the fourth) were more or less room mates all through our Engineering lyf at Kanchi. To spruce things up we had Domz joining us :-) . Doma is one hell of a person to be with! All thanks to his childish innocence! :-)

I was in no mood to sleep after getting back home. So i picked up my Guitar to try a few notes. It's actually been quite a while that I've laid my hands on it. Somehow things kept me busy and getting back to the Guitar was one beautiful experience. A couple of months back while at Bangalore, I 'd learnt to play KHNH's theme song. With no practice, KHNH doles out pretty bad from my hands now but it's only a few days before I get back to my professional level ;-) .

And now there's this Pune transfer lurking round the corner :-( !
