Childline India Foundation primarily supported by The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment - Government of India has come up with an initiative of having a one stop phone helpline for children. Any child in Distress or in need of help may now call the toll free number 1098 for assisstance. More about this initiative at their webportal [here](http://childlineindia.org.in/ "here") .

Next time you see a street kid or just anyone's kid in need of help, all you need to do is dial 1098. Spread word of 1098 to every kid that you come across. You never know when s/he may find it useful!
