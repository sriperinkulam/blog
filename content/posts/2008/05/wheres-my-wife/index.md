title: Where's my wife?
---

It's been almost a month now that I'm married and I don't even know who my wife is! :-)

Every junior who happens to talk to me asks the same question - Heard you've had a registered marriage! And you didn't even tell me? All thanks to that wonderful person who's started the rumour. And I wish I knew who that holy soul is!

Before the rumor does any more damage, This is just to officially declare that there was no registered marriage! I'm pretty much a bachelor! :-)

Ah! and if you happen to trace out that virtual wife of mine please do ask her to sign the same declaration here! :-)
