Around 0300 today, I was woken up rudely to a blaring sound. For a moment I assumed it was from the Seismic City alert system that CDMX has. Turned out, it was from the old blue dell laptop that I currently use to run NextcloudPi. For some reason, looks like it rebooted and went into a huge panic mode because it lost time sync. Yanked all the cables and shut it down. Something to figure out over the next few days when I have time. {{< permalink >}}
