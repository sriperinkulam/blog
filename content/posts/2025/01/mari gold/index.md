NO [Mari Gold](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/ciudad-de-mexico/miguel-hidalgo_1999281/restaurant/mari-gold) ! You don't get to call - a wrap of leaf salad drizzled with vinagarette and some flavorless yam, doused in running egg yolk - a KATHI ROLL! Such a disgrace! Wasn't too excited about going here initially and now I'm more than convinced not to look back once.  {{< permalink >}}
