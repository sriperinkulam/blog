title: How to Restart an Ecosystem
---

When I first flew over Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park in March, 2004, I saw a lush, Eden-like landscape. But I couldn’t pick out a single animal. In the 1960s, the park’s large fauna population was one of the densest and most diverse in Africa, earning Gorongosa the slogan “The place where Noah left the Ark.”
