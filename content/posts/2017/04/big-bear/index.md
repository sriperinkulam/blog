Out for coffee at Big Bear in Dedham. Again a family run cafe with some real interesting and tasty eats. The huge picture of a bear on one of the walls was captivating. Also, the 'Caution, Bears in this area' right near the pedestrian crossing was pretty tounge-in-cheek!

Just before we left, had a quick chat with the owner on a beautiful wooden slab he had designed. Apparently it's called fractal wood burning art and is basically simulating lightning on wood to create intricate art forms. Pretty neat stuff!
