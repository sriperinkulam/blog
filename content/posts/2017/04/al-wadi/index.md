Decided to head to Al wadi for some Lebanese food. Was in for a pleasant surprise as we entered. I cross this restaurant almost every time I run the VFW route and never really thought it would be as 'decked up' from the looks outside. Some real good choice and tasty food. Besides they also had a groupon which made it all more worth it.

Turkish coffee for the first time. Boy, that's strong!
