A long drive after a long time followed by the laziest productive weekend so far. Early morning soccer talk walks, IKEA mending, pedicure with the family, new restaurant digs, some tech geeking and a lot of down time on the couch. Took the scenic driveway to Penn and 76N to cut into NJ instead of the regular 95N. Looking forward to getting back to building mileage for Wapack and Back this week!
