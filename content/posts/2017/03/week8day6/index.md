Painful 8 miler at Middlesex fells. Shouldn't have hit the trails this quickly. Looks like the shin needs to recover a bit more. The weather didn't make things easier either. Super windy with temps in sub 15F. Today totally 'felt' like being out there in the wild. Hopefully the weather gets better tomorrow.
