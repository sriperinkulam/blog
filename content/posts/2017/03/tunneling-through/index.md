title: Tunneling through
---

Every single time we pass through this tunnel in Hamden, CT; I'm reminded of the Katraj-Sinhagad tunnel - The start point of one of the most iconic overnight hikes in Pune. The brief patch of land atop the old tunnel where you get to see the whole of Pune city and beyond in its glistening glory with heavy gusts of chilly winds blowing on you face from all directions...one of those moments that got me hooked to hiking and which would eventually bring in memories that would last for a lifetime... ![IMG_3825.jpeg](images/IMG_3825.jpeg)
