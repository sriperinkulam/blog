title: Lagoony Morning
---

Early morning walk by the Charles Esplanade / lagoon. Been wanting to come over to this side for quite sometime now and today happened to be just the right day! Crisp air, early morning spring chill and a good hour long run/walk! Need to do this more regularly. Also time to get into a kayak/sail boat this summer.
