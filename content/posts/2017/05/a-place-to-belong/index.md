title: A Place to Belong
---

> Three years ago, folk singer [Joel Shupack](http://bit.ly/2p0XD5n) set off from Portland, Oregon on his bicycle. The plan was to ride across the entire U.S., all the way to New Hampshire.
> 
> Joel's dream was to escape a life that wasn’t filling him up.  He wanted to travel, to give himself space to think, to make sense out of things.
> 
> On this episode, he shares his story. It’s a story about leaving behind a comfortable life at home, in order to follow your heart. It shows us what a cross-country bike tour is really like – not just the glamorous idea, but the tough reality.
> 
> And finally, it’s a story about figuring out how to belong.
