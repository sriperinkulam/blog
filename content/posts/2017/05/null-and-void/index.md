Yet another brilliant podcast from Radiolab. The first time I heard about the jury system here in the US, I was pleasantly surprised. This was a concept I never knew existed and while weighing the pros and cons of the system, I could never really decide which side weighed more.

This talk runs along that fine ridge and broaches - jury nullification, yet another mighty 'toolset' the jury holds.
