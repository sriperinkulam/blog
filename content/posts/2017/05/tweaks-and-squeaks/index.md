Strongly considering setting up an updated workflow to publish from my mobile device. Currently chunk of the processing is handled by and within the 'workflow' app. Should probably move those controls from the app over to a custom function for better flexibility. This long weekend should be a good timeframe to get the wheels rolling.

Also the workflow app seems to be picking up an additional variable - calshow in urls from posts that are responses. Need to figure out what's churning there!
