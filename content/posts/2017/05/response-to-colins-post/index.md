title: Response to Colin's post
---

I really like your 'how-to' getting plugged posts, Colin! Always something to glean! Most of the improvisations I make on my site have been pretty crude - I dice the meat in an mu-plugin (essentially a custom functions file) and leave it at that. I really need to work on better documenting or standardizing my code.

> What started as a quick update to split the plugin into parts (so that it wasn’t all one monolithic file) became quite a major one. My original plan was to move both hooks for updating the post content to separate included files – it hasn’t quite gone according to plan.
