A good 8mile run from the yoga studio to home. Clocked about 01:25.

As I was waiting at a signal near BWH a fellow runner who looked pretty shaken asked if she could tag along for a few blocks. Apparently some random guy on the road pushed her on to the wall and tried molesting her...Disgusting! The roads were pretty well lit AND there were quite a few folks out there. Appalling that one has to be always on guard in Boston too.
