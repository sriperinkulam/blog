13.5 miles on the treadmill at the Y. Let's check that off as the first half for this month and my first ever on a treadmill. Was obviously NOT fun.

The weather out was in the balmy lower 50s. Initial plan was to finally get some miles out in the trails at Hale Reservation. With the road entry closed out and snow still lingering at about 7-8" on the trails, didn't really make sense to attempt a distance run there. Hopefully tomorrow's 15 is the last on the treadmill.
