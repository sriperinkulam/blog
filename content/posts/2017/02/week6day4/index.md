6 miles at the Y in an hour. Not bad. Looks like I'm slowly defaulting to my 10 minute miles. Initially planned to run in the morning. Guess I was way too fatigued to get up. Also looks like last nights 8 mile run hit me hard.

Work, Study and other Misc. things seem to be heavily dragging me down. Feels like I've not had a good break in a while..Nevertheless, so glad I'm training for this.
