Moved on to [Dandasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/dandasana/), [Paschimottanasana A](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/paschimottanasana-a/) and [B](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/paschimottanasana-b/), and [Purvottanasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/purvottanasana/) :clap: . And looks like I no longer need to do the standing sequence twice! Though I still haven't got [Uttitha Hastha Padangusthasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/utthita-hasta-padangushthasana/) (the only part in the standing sequence that I dread every single time I do it!) quite right, I'm happy to move on to other asanas while working on this one over time.
