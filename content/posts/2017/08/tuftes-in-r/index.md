> The idea behind Tufte in R is to use R - the most powerful open-source statistical programming language - to replicate excellent visualisation practices developed by Edward Tufte. It’s not a novel approach - there are plenty of excellent R functions and related packages wrote by people who have much more expertise in programming than myself. I simply collect those resources in one place in an accessible and replicable format, adding a few bits of my own coding discoveries.
