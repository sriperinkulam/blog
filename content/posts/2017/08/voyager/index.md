title: Where the Sun Don't Shine
---

If there's one thing you were to listen to today, let it be this! August 25, 2012. Apparently that's when they estimate the voyager crossed the final frontier and entered interstellar space. Cruising at about 35,000 miles/hour it's the ONLY man made object to enter these realms...All this with technology that's 45 years old!

> Today we take a quick look up at a hole in the sky and follow an old story as it travels beyond the reach of the sun. We hear from some moon-peeping listeners and then, on the 40th anniversary of their launch, we check in with the Voyager space probes. We revisit the story of the romantic time capsules that were placed onboard, and a question we asked five years ago: where exactly is Voyager 1?
