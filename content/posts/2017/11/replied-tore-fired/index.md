Syncthing looks pretty interesting. I’ll probably give it a shot for another project of mine. Thanks for the pointer.

For the pi3 setup, one USB port supports both the keyboard and mouse, while another serves the hard disk, leaving two more ports free. I use an hdmi adapter for the screen. Once I get a better hang of using the raw power of the Ubuntu core, I’ll probably be able to put the pi3 to better use!
