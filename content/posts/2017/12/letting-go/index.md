title: Letting go
---

Close to [three months](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/08/10/moving-downwards/) since I was introduced to [Uttitha Hastha Padangusthasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/utthita-hasta-padangushthasana/) and I still find this asana pretty challenging. This Wednesday's practice was tremendously draining. Spent close to five minutes just trying to focus and balance, but it just didn't flow through. Back home that night, I sought Miss Me to figure out why I was failing miserably at this particular asana. She walked over and watched me struggling to balance and in her zen mode suggested, I just look straight ahead (without paying any attention to the leg or the toe) and lift the leg by the toe till my hamstrings allowed and then firm up the other leg to balance. That worked right in the first attempt!!

Subconsciously, I've been unnecessarily stressing out on this one asana for this long for no reason! Now that I've gained more control by essentially letting go, today's practice felt much more relaxed and rejuvenating. This December 12th, it would be six months since we started our Ashtanga practice. From being very skeptical, I've come to a point where I'm thoroughly enjoying the practice. And we're not yet finished with the basic sequence! :claps:
