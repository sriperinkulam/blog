Took the day off last Friday and hit the coast after the regular early morning Ashtanga class. Last years rain-check for the whale watching got us pretty lucky. Sighted around 6 to 7 whales at Stellwagen bank, 31 miles off the coast from Gloucester. A couple of them got up close (and not so personal) to the boat. These Humpbacks were pretty sober. Not much [breaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_surfacing_behaviour#Breaching_and_lunging), but they did flaunt their flukes! First in-person sighting and I'm psyched. Water has always fascinated me and with the Scuba diving a [few years back](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2012/08/19/scuba-diving-pondicherry/), I've learnt to appreciate the depths a lot more.

Later that afternoon, spent a few hours at the Good Harbor beach. Water was much warmer than expected but pretty calm, possibly due to low tide. Hiked up a small hill right by the beach for a real nice view of the ocean. Absolutely no Greenheads. Crane beach still trumps!

Some delicious dinner at a friends place and we head back home. So glad I decided to take the day off.

Also time to add [Blue Mind](http://www.bluemind.life/) to my reading list.
