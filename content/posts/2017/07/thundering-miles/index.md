title: Thundering miles
---

Got the kids out for a short 4mile orienteering session. Fit in the short 1/2 mile trail in [Dr. Blakely Hoar Sanctuary](http://www.brooklinema.gov/1050/D-Blakeley-Hoar-Sanctuary) that's right in the backyard.

Humid in the higher 80s. Good recipe for some heavy showers that followed later in the evening. Hit the reservoir dirt road for a good three 1.6mile loops. Nothing like running while it's pouring cats and dogs and you're out there in the woods. Effectively ~9miles spent outdoors. Great way to kick off the long weekend!
