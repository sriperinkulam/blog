I've really liked [Standard Notes](https://app.standardnotes.org) and [Simplenote](https://app.simplenote.com/). Both have markdown, tag support and sync across machines. I'd weigh in on the former for encryption and the latter for version control. I've never used nvAlt, so not quite sure what I'm stacking against.

> Internet! I need help. I've been using nvALT for years and years, and have years and years of content in it.
