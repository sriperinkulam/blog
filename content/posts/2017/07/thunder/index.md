Today's ashtanga practice was insanely powerful. At the end of the first set of the standing pose, I felt like a dark cloud just about letting go of its huge water droplets and by the end of the second set I was a completely wet noodle.

Not quite sure if it was the temperature in the room or just the internal heat from the body. What I do know is, I'm slowly but surely getting better in being in the moment and able to focus better on my asana and breath work.

Today's practice was for close to an hour. As we add more asanas and sequences, we may have to come in earlier in the morning to finish by 7.
