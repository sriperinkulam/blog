title: The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI
---

Makes me wonder if we as humans, were engineered by another intelligent form as a version of an AI, to create a smarter generation of AI. And if this really is a cascading iteration, which neural node are we in? Drawing a parallel, the current 'generation' of AI isn't probably 'aware' of the existence of us humans and are currently evolving in a 'universe' of their own and self engineering themselves based on their own feedback loops. We probably will never truly understand how and what they'll evolve to. Or as Dennett says, unless a system can explain its actions better than we humans, it should not be trusted.

> Last year, a strange self-driving car was released onto the quiet roads of Monmouth County, New Jersey. The experimental vehicle, developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia, didnâ€™t look different from other autonomous cars, but it was unlike anything demonstrated by Google, Tesla, or General Motors, and it showed the rising power of artificial intelligence.
