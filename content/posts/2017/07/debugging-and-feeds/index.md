Realized today that a [code fix](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/06/30/squashing-the-bug/) that I had implemented sometime back, inadvertently introduced a minor bug in my workflow. Will have to get around fixing this sometime later this week.

On another note, I decided to temporarily suspend my self-hosted [freshRSS](https://freshrss.org/) installation and moved my feeds to [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/). Currently I don't see a huge benefit of self hosting it unless I'm able to implement responding directly from that interface.
