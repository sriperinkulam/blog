title: Are we there yet?
---

After a good early morning yoga workout, took the kids out for a 8 mile hike on the Skyline trail in the Fells. Half way through they were totally spent. Nevertheless, made it back to the parking lot in about 5.5 hours. This was their longest trail hike ever and I'm so proud they endured it pretty well!

Later in the evening, we took them out to 47 Metres down. The girls were literally sinking into their seats in fear. The boys were pretty neutral. Divs spilled a good portion of her iced coke on me. The hike was the toughest on her and I believe she was being vengeful for what I made her go through earlier in the day :).
