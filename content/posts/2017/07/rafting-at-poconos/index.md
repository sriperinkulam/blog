title: Rafting at Poconos
---

Back to the waters after a long time. I believe we covered about 12 miles in about 4.5 hours. Wasn't as tired as I expected it to be.

Some insanely funny falls from the rafts. We almost lost our captain to the waters! Had about four Grade II and a couple of Grade III rapids. I think I'm prepared for higher grades now. Also [strengthened my resolve](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/05/20/lagoony-morning/) to get a kayak this year.

Was a fabulous way to celebrate a couple of birthdays in the family. Should do this more often.
