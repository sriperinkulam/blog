Took the oath this July 4th. With Miss Me's birthday falling on the same day and the event by itself being on July 4th, this one is going to be pretty symbolic and memorable.

Thinking deeply, I've let go of something I've been associated with for the last 30 odd years. All within a few weeks, my identity has switched (officially). It probably is going to take a few months for this to sink in. For now, its more paperwork for surrendering my Indian citizenship and securing the OCI/PIO status.
