7 years of togetherness. Thanks for everything you do every single moment. You complete us, Miss Me!

\[x\] Coffee date at Esspresso Cafe in Jamaica Plain. Decent stuff but no vegan options. Probably will not go back here again. \[x\] Volunteered at the VT100, an altogether [different experience](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/07/16/vt100-finish/) \[x\] Suresh paced someone for the first time and did a 14miler, So proud! \[x\] Helped fix the van's flat tire. Coincidence? \[x\] Fabulous drive back home. Fog, Mist, Sunrise, mountains, clear roads and music...Should have stopped and got a few pictures.. \[x\] Missed the Ashtanga practice by 8 minutes - Was already zapped though \[x\] Coffee @ Cafe Flora - Pinball machine by some artistic wood tables - Will be back here sometime soon. \[x\] Breakfast at Veggie Galaxy with Suresh. LOVE these relaxed morning eat-outs. \[x\] Ayurveda training \[x\] Appa's [FB post](https://www.facebook.com/sperinkulam/posts/1818546468162703) fires up some heavy commenting!
