title: Replied to:Hyannis notes | Srikanth Perinkulam
---

Philip, I dynamically add the 'Liked:' and 'Replied to:' phrase to the title of the post using some crude code in my back-end. Essentially, I use a couple of [workflows](https://workflow.is/) to fetch the link/article details and then add the markup et al using a custom functions in my wp install. Would be more than happy to share them if you're interested in taking a look.

Also I noticed your posts are not marked up with microformats for [like](http://indieweb.org/like) and [replies](https://indieweb.org/reply). The [Indieweb PressThis](https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb-press-this) bookmarklet should ideally add the necessary microformat markup to your posts. For some reason, It doesn't seem to be doing so. I'll take a look later today to see what's transpiring there.

Depending on your publishing preference there are a few other alternatives. Not sure if you've explored these already:

- [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io/) : Aaron's posting interface works great on both desktop and mobile devices
- [Omnibear](https://indieweb.org/Omnibear) : Keith's Chrome bookmarklet
- Using the Bookmarklet Free or URL Forwarder apps on android and tweaking the settings mentioned in one of Chris Aldrich's [notes](http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/sharing-from-the-indieweb-on-mobile-android-with-apps-and)
- The [Wordpress plugin](https://github.com/colin-walker/wordpress-likes-and-replies/tree/master/includes) developed by [Colin Walker](http://colinwalker.blog/) which coupled with his workflows could be used to post from an apple device.

> That previous post was an attempt to “like” this post using IndieWeb Press This. I’d used the tool successfully earlier, but this time I didn’t see the “Liked:” prefix on the post (and I don’t see the “Reply:” prefix on this one).
