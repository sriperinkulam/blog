Liked: Micro.blog Desktop

> I’ve been using micro.blog for a few weeks now. The new way of posting and owning my own content is growing on me and I am really enjoying posting to my own site again. One thing I found was I wasn’t really interacting much during the day, I put this down to not having a desktop app.
