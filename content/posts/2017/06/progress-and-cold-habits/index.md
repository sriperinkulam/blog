title: Progress and cold habits
---

5 reps of Sun salutations A, 8 reps of Sun salutation B, 2 reps each of Padangusthasana, Padahasthasana, Uthita Trikonanasa and Parivrita Trikonasana leading into [Uthita Parshvakonasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/basic-sequence-fundamental-positions/item/utthita-parshvakonasana/) and [Parivrita Parshvakonasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/basic-sequence-fundamental-positions/item/parivritta-parshvakonasana/) and finally closing out with the three seated poses - [Yoga mudra](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/the-finishing-sequence/item/yoga-mudra/),[Padmasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/the-finishing-sequence/item/padmasana/),[Utplutih](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/the-finishing-sequence/item/utplutih/) and Shavasana. Took close to an hour for the whole session.

On a related note, slowly transitioning to taking cold water showers everyday. Discussions with [David](https://distanceathletics.com) at the TARC Camp earlier this month and reading [What doesn't kill us](https://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us) have nudged me to get back to my old habits which I conveniently gave up when I moved to the US four years ago. I'll have to revisit this once temps go way down south but for now I'm more than happy sticking to it!
