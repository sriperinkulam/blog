title: 'Replied to:Expanding my movement practice: Animal movements'

This sounds pretty interesting, Philip. Something I should consider adding to my workout regimen. I've always had a tough time coordinating my limbs and following flow sequences. Several years back after a failed attempt at learning [Kalaripayettu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalaripayattu) , I was heavily demoralized. My flexibility seemed to be abysmally low and I had a real tough time getting back to group classes.

Earlier this month my wife finally got me to sign up for [Ashtanga Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_vinyasa_yoga). It's only been a few weeks and I already see tremendous improvement in my ability to focus, coordinate my moves and remember sequences. I guess the break in between was much needed...

> My most recent addition to my movement practice, just started, is animal movements. These are basically just ground exercises where the shapes are inspired by animal movements: Bear and Crab crawls, Ape and Duck walks, transitions from one to another.
