Miss Me and I went for an observation class of Ashtanga at Down Under Yoga before work. Been on cards for a while now and we finally decided to give it a shot today. To be honest, looks pretty daunting and mesmerizing! Given my flexibility, rather the lack of it, this is going to be pretty interesting!
