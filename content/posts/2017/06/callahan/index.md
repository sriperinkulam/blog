Great day out with the kids. Hit Callahan State Park for a short hike. Getting them out of the house was probably the toughest part ! Today's hike was also a test run before we take them on a longer hike next weekend. The 8 mile [Skyline trail](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/01/21/middlesex-17-miler/) at Middlesex fells should be a challenging hiking exposure for them. Can't wait!

Last Christmas, we got them all hydration bags as a suggestive nudge. They've been super excited to use those and this summer was a good time to get them rolling on the trails together. Only wish they lived closer to Boston. We're lucky to have several splendid trails around here. Would have been a fabulous training ground for them...Well, well...
