title: Rained out!
---

The weekends' here and the weather looks perfect. Thundershowers forecast for most of tomorrow and a hazy Sunday. Should get some longish miles out there.

Reminds me of the innumerable weekends spent hiking along the western ghats checking forts off the list and snacking off the roadside!

Will probably head to noon reservation tomorrow. Was initially thinking early morning around 4ish. But given the weather will probably join the TARC folks later in the day. Miles ahead!
