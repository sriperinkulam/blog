title: Sun Salutations B
---

Up at 04:30am and had ample time to get ready. Did a dry runthrough of the sequence with Miss Me just before we left home and that provedto be pretty useful. Today’s class was much better in terms of execution.Practiced Sun Salutations A for about eight times. Kate then walked me throughSun Salutation B thrice and left me to practice. I felt the transition from Ato B was pretty fluid and got a decent hang of the B sequence. Closed out with Shavasanaafter 10 breaths each in the different variants of Padmasana.

Felt much more energetic and composed today! Quite possibly dueto the forced yet regulated breathing and just ‘being in the zone’.

Ought to learn the number codes and/or Sanskrit names. These links below seem to have both!
