Liked: [Expanding my movement practice: Push hands](https://www.philipbrewer.net/2017/06/27/expanding-my-movement-practice-push-hands/)

> I haven’t written much yet about adding push hands to my movement practice, mainly because I don’t feel competent to describe it well. Push hands is a taiji training technique—a way to learn how to accept and redirect force.
