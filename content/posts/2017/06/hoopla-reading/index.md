title: Hoopla Reading
---

Biggest find so far this weekend! Just realized one could borrow upto 10 digital titles (audiobooks, e-books, music and video) a month from [hoopla](https://hoopladigital.com) via a local library.

Started reading [What doesn't kill us](https://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us) by Scott Carney. [Shantaram](https://m.barnesandnoble.com/w/shantaram-gregory-david-roberts/1100338449) has been on the back burner for quite sometime now. Hopefully will get to it soon.
