title: Moving on to the fundamentals
---

Was introduced to [Padangusthasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/basic-sequence-fundamental-positions/item/padangushthasana/), [Padahastasana](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/basic-sequence-fundamental-positions/item/pada-hastasana/) followed by [Trikonasana A](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/basic-sequence-fundamental-positions/item/utthita-trikonasana/) and [Trikonasana B](https://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/basic-sequence-fundamental-positions/item/parivritta-trikonasana/) today. Called for a bit of stability and a lot of focus!

I seem to have a got a hang of the Sun Salutations. I did catch myself doing a few mistakes, but guess that's good. Was in sync with Miss Me for the most part today and realised I wasn't doing the last three closing sequences quite right...nuances! Some more practice and it should soon be second nature...
