As planned a [few days](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/05/26/tweaks-and-squeaks/) back, I rewrote some back-end code to minimize the dependency on the workflow app and better integrate with direct desktop publishing. But for a  few isolated kinks, this should be set. This should now give me more flexibility to post from indie publishing platforms and set the stage for other enhancements.
