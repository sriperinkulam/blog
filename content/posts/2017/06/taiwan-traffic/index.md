That anomaly grows exponentially with the density of traffic :). You could barely go fast with so many vehicles around you and the thrill of scraping past the other vehicles keeps you hyper alert!

I'm eagerly looking forward to driving back in India later this year, after four years here in the US. Wonder if my muscle memory would still work it's magic and if the impulse will play along!

> Back in the early 2000s I worked for a Taiwanese company (Acer) and travelled reasonably frequently to Taiwan. At the time I blogged a little on a site called H2G2 – the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition – inspired by the late, great Douglas Adams.
