A terrific day outing to Las Estacas. Reminded me of our [Silver Springs](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/02/19/no-morning-blues/) visit in FL about five years ago. S kept mentioning this has been the best outing ever! She surprised us with wanting to jump off a 10ft high swing into the spring. I was hesitant at first - But boy I am so glad we did it! She didn't want to go back for seconds but she absolutely loved the jump. A good deal of swimming, catching floating leaves and just wading around. Swimming upstream was a real fight!
