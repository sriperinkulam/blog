S has been thoroughly enjoying these Reforma Sundays. Over the last few weekends she's scooter-ed till Sofitel and back. Today she wanted to do the 'Three families bike ride'. Wanted to stop and get photos at her landmarks - The Panda, The archer's fountain and the Angel Statue. She did ride around 7 miles totally! Betty - her bike needed constant refueling and the rider needed a breakfast fix - Bagel + Cream Cheese and Dragon fruit juice, on the way back. Lovely day to be outdoors!
