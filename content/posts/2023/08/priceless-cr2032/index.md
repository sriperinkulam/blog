Sometime back S's night light bulb fused out. I replaced it with a tiny flickering LED lamp but she wasn't very impressed since the switch was super tiny. Went to Home depot today with her and bought a switch that she liked. Spent about half an hour together and came up with this 'wireless' night lamp. She absolutely loves how it looks!
