S had a seemingly sudden meltdown on the way back from her roller skating class asking for a 'Hello Kitty Donut'. She hopped off her bike and said she won't ride it until we got her one that very instant. M told her we could talk about it once we're home. The looming thunder clouds didn't seem to budge her too. M seemed to have had a word with her and that somehow changed her mind - a bit. Finally she did succumb, however vehemently showing her immense dissatisfaction by bawling and walking her bike home.

M brings me up to speed once we're home. A couple months ago, M apparently had promised her a donut the day she wore all her protecci√≥n while skating. Today happens to be that day and in her mind S had all right to protest when we didn't close our end of the deal.

This kids got an elephant's memory just like her Mom! While that's a terrific thing, I've got work cut out for me!
