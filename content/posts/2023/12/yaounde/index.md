Early this month we put in our bids for our next posting. We heard back on Monday that we're scheduled to head to Yaounde next! This was our top bid and we're super excited! M also heard back on her CA-AEFM position. With all the NCC and NEC moves, the LNA and ConGen training, prepping for Yaounde and a few other things, next year's going to be super busy and interesting.
