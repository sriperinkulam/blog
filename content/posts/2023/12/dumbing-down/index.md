A few things I'd really like to dumb down or sort out over the next few weeks:

**Site**: This site runs on WordPress, has facets of the indieweb, has ActivityPub and a crude implementation of self engineered micropost interface. All cool but needs quite a trim to make the best use of all these features.

**Hardware/Infra**: VPS, VPN, Odroid for reverse proxy, NCP, NUC, Moose, External hard disks...Love the current implementation for the various utilities they serve. However, I see myself spending lesser and lesser time in front of the PC. Which is good? But which also means I need to find a better way to manage these in the little time I want to spend.

**GPX**: Go on a hike or ride? Automatically log this on my site. Gotta have that super neat Stamen map. I did get really close to setting this up [sometime back](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/09/garmin-plugin-2/) but got left on the wayside. Also time to update my [Outdoors plugin](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/)?

**Firefly3**: Love this tool for finance tracking. Need to build that rule engine to automate some of those imports and reports.

**Snikket/Matrix/Slidge**: Need to get this sorted out to be part of those groups that still rely on WhatsApp. I setup a [bridge](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/20/bridged/) sometime back but deleted it because I was rarely using it. More of a nice-to-have so may not quite get to this anytime soon.

**Memories**: Selective photo sharing with family or friends. Send a link instead of sharing photos individually. Love the nextcloud setup so far. Would be neat if I can take this up a notch.

**Music**: Kinda like my current Navidrome setup. Would like a bit more flexibility in terms of song or folder access though. Smarter playlists? Also multidevice sync? Music system?

**Notes Sync**: Currently relying on Signal notes to self and Trilium send for bookmarks. Need to automate this for self sorting with tags in Trilium notes.

**Smart sceen**: On demand and power efficient display for Calendars, Adana, Gallery, dashboard display, news updates etc. Thinking MagicMirror but a bit more optimized. Repurpose that RPi or Odroid once it's all integrated into the NUC?
