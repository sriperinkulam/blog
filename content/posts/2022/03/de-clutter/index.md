title: De-clutter
---

Over the last few months, I have been able to drastically reduce the digital clutter with two key tools - [Anonaddy](https://anonaddy.com/) and [KTN](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/). Anonaddy lets you spin up email aliases on-the-go and sever them as needed.Â  KTN let's you subscribe to newsletters in your feed reader via RSS. Pretty cool concept and I love how easy it is to use! Highly recommend!
