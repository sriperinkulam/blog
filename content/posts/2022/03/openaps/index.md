TIL about [OpenAPS](https://openaps.org/) \[Open Artificial Pancreatic System Project\]. A fascinating take on owning medical data related to ones' sugar levels and automating insulin intake for folks with Type1Diabetes. I never knew managing T1D was so complicated until I read [Graham Jenson's post](https://bag.srkn.org/share/621e36d4e6a8b9.06257268). My uncle had a close call recently with super low sugar levels. Can't imagine people having to deal with this every single day!

Also need to lookup SDR radio's one of these days!
