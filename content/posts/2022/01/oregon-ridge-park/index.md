Took Appa and S out to the Oregon Ridge Park while M helped getting things ready for Amma's Shraadam. While at it I also got to test the new action camera that we bought last month.

Quite a chilly and windy day. That didn't deter S from having a blast at the playground. The 'hike' quickly turned into a playground outing. I wouldn't complain. Amazed at how well she handled the low temps.
