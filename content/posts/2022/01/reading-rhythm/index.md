title: Reading Rhythm

Over the last month, I seem to have switched into a better reading rhythm. I'd probably attribute it to having a bit more time and mind-space for myself. Also, I figured I needed a better system to keep track of the books I had in queue.Â  While Wallabag has been a terrific tool to assimilate, read and archive articles that I've come across online; I badly needed one for books too. Last month, I set a bare-bones system in my note-taking tool and this seems to do the trick for now!

I don't have a goal as such for this year. I do however want to get to these books that I have in my reading queue.
