[@Alligator](https://micro.blog/Alligator) I'm glad I got most of my family off apple a few years ago.The ecosystem and apps are great but there's so little room for fun tweaking. I've had my eyes on Dex and Ubuntu's convergence for a while too. For now though, I'm happy with my modular workstation setup. Another stream of thought is to port the fam to a Snikket/XMPP/matrix ecosystem so we're lesser dependent on external networks. That's going to take a bit of planning and coaxing though untill the [matrix bridges](https://matrix.org/bridges/) are a bit more robust :).
