title: Trolley trail
---

This first, we wanted to take Miss S out for some good time outdoors. With various factors at play, we haven't had that mental space to prioritize this over the last few months and this is something we definitely wanted to change this year. The Trolley trail was an easy pick since we'd already been there a [few](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/number-nine-trolley-trail-hike/) [times](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/06/14/reflections-by-the-rail-line/) in 2020.

We directly went to this 'secret' spot that's hidden right at the beginning of the trail. The fog and the weather made this space look even more mystical! Miss S had a terrific time hopping around and throwing pebbles stones across the stream. Later on during the drive back she went on to claim all the fog on the road was because she threw those pebbles in the water. Today was magical!
