The more that I read and the more that I build, with every additional service that I self-host, I realize there are so many points of failure - each becoming more evident as time passes and experience grows. The blaring one's get attended to sooner or later, and the not-so-urgent one's remain there - slowly tended to on the whims and fancies of time and interest. Until, from a different perspective, what you judged to be urgent or frivolous flips and then you are just not sure what you are dealing with.

This must be why it's so addictive. There are more questions than straightforward solutions. There's so much uncertainty veiled with the promise of freedom, curiosity and learning. There's the thrill in making things work despite it being a non-standard approach. And ultimately it's all yours - the wins and the losses. Well, mostly the losses. But hey, even before you stop to assess, there's something new round the corner that someone's built - Intricate yet imperfect. Just what you need to spin-off in that directionâ€¦

This. is. why? What's your reason?
