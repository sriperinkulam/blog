A few laps at MC with S and V. Went in closer to noon and the temps were just right! Nasal only with the mask on. Right after the first lap, I had this tightness in the upper chest which eased out over the next few loops and I definitely could have picked up my pace if I really wanted.  The calves were 'talking' right after the run and the fresh OJ which I gulped down was just what the body needed...Great consecutive run after yesterday. I'm kinda liking getting back to this.
