Spent some time today quasi-automating the gpx fetch and mapping from garmin. A [modified python script](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/06/garmin/) fetches the gpx from garmin-connect and builds the map-tiles that I can now embed in my [workout posts](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/tag/workout/). I simultaneously back these up in my nextcloud instance for redundancy and am otally thrilled how this is all come together!
