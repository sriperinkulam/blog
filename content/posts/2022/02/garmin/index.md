As I slowly get back into running, I realized my [garmin plugin](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/05/30/owning-my-garmin-data/) had a minor bug. When I built this last year, I had inadvertently hard-coded the years field in the [summary](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/) and the totals for the current year where obviously messed up. For now I've patched it with a quick-fix. Will have to automate it when I have a bit more time and I think I already know what needs to be done.

On that note, I also chanced upon [Anders](https://www.andersle.no/posts/2018/gpxplot/gpxplot.html)' terrific [gpxplotter](https://github.com/andersle/gpxplotter). With slight modifications I should be able to generate neat map tiles from the GPX files and incorporate it my plugin. Project for another day but I am pretty excited about this!
