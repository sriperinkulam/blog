title: Katraj to Sinhagad - Take 5

\[caption id="attachment\_37938" align="aligncenter" width="1200"\]![](images/DSC02891-1200x900.jpg) Sinhagad at a distance. This picture is from on of my previous hikes.\[/caption\]

Sharp at 0600 as we finally reach the road that winds up to Sinhagad, Ankur and I take a moment to savor the twilight chill. The last 7.5 hours has been nothing short of mesmerizing and rewarding. Just as it was twelve years ago when I did this hike with a much larger group.

Part of me wanted to just camp right on the first hill. To think of it, this has been something I've wanted to do for a while. Next time around, I should probably start a bit early and set camp on the hill just before Sinhagad so I can catch sunrise there.

Yesterday, something which had been up in the air for more than a year and half, finally fell in place. So this hike is also a celebration of sorts.
