Between moving, on-boarding, never-ending-checklists and spurts of laziness the last few months have been ridiculously busy. Visited the Museum of Natural History yesterday. Couldn't do the Butterfly pavilion since tickets were sold-out. Could have planned this better! Nevertheless, had a great time out!
