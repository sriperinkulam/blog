_A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:_

The last few weeks have been pretty 'choppy'. Some recent developments on the work front has gotten us back to Boston. Always wonderful being back here. Looks like New-England has had a pretty mild winter and we're making sure we take Shasta out as much as possible!

Over the next couple weeks we'll have to make a few interesting decisions. Between grad programs, fellowships and other exciting opportunities; 2020 is already off to a happening start!

It's tax filing time! I was [super pissed with TurboTax last year](https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ec4320d980f38.10621582). This year I helped file taxes for my in-laws using the [FreeFillableForms](https://www.freefilefillableforms.com/) option. Found it to be super easy and straight forward. Will most likely use it for my personal taxes too.

**Interesting podcasts this week**

[Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/): Chanced upon this podcast early this week while sifting through AntennaPod and the premise sounded pretty interesting - Hacking and cyber-warfare. My podcast consumption has drastically come down over the last few months. This will hopefully get me back on the podtrack!

**Interesting tools this week**

[MineTime](https://minetime.ai/) : Think 'smarter' calendars.

[Digikam](https://www.digikam.org/) : Self hosted photo management with facial recognition! I'd probably pair this with my Nextcloud photo library over the next few days.

**Interesting reads this week**

[Lifesaving rescue on Mount Washington](https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ee9d823b05bf0.76779254): Yet another terrific read from Ty Gagne! Note to self to get that [HikeSafe card](https://wildlife.state.nh.us/safe/).

[Talking to youth about privacy, security and digital spaces](https://outline.com/eDqTtT): Wonderful piece, Ian. Loved the concept of identifying an 'approach point'. Most of what he mentioned also applies to adults and more so elderly parents who've jumped on the digital scene without much awareness on the privacy implications!

[The medications that change who we are](https://outline.com/ustEXp): Not quite surprising but pretty intriguing read on how dependent we're on medication these days. Think twice before you pop that pill!

[Why Astrology matters](https://outline.com/mBnzcp): My family (prior generation) was (is?) a strong believer in Astrology. From making birth charts/Horoscopes, wearing different rings on the fingers to influence the 'stars', matching horoscopes prior to weddings, and most significantly to pick an auspicious time to travel; The sentiment has definitely changed over the last decade or so, but hey, it's still there!

Astrology has stood the test of several hundred generations now and there's got to be an iota of truth somewhere out there. That said, I still have an excruciatingly hard time believing that the stars and planets have anything to do with one's life developments.

[Opinion | We’re Banning Facial Recognition. We’re Missing the Point.](https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ee9d85ebfadf0.97957728): It all boils down to regulation. Or technology that's able to shroud a person's exteriors both physically, electrically and magnetically!
