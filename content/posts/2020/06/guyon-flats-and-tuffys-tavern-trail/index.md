Yet another great day outdoors! We plan on doing more technical and/or longer hikes with Shasta and today was one of those 'dry-runs'. We were out there in the woods for about 3.5 hours and she did terrific!

A decent elevation profile, blended in river-crossing, and of-course wonderful company. With an early start, the 6.5miles didn't quite feel that distance. A bit of a drive from home that was absolutely worth it!
