Gloomy weather, impending rain and breezy forecast - Great way to kick off the weekend with a short hike. Meena didn't get to see the falls [last time we were on this trail](https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/15/alberta-road-thru-trail-hike/). So we decided to head back here with Shasta in the carrier. Made it back home just in time before the thunder-storms kicked in.
