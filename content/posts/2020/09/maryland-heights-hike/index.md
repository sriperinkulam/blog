A beautiful climb up Maryland Heights and some great views off the cliff overlooking Harpers Ferry. Our first hike in WV! Fabulous weather and Patapsco was shimmering all along. Brought Appa here a few days later and he was able to walk all across the bridge and over to the other side of the river.
