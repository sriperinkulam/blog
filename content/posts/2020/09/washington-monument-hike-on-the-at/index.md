title: Washington Monument Hike on the AT
year: 2020
---

A beautiful hike up north on the Appalachian Trail towards Washington Monument. With a slowly rising dense fog and absolutely nobody else for company almost all through the hike, this 6ish mile out and back loop was just what we needed on a Sunday morning. The monument was a wonderful step-back in time and reminded me of the multitude of forts back in the Sahyadris.
