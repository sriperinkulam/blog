title: Alberta road - Thru trail Hike
year: 2020
---

At the end of our last week's hike I sensed we were close to a small dam but we didn't quite get to that point . Wanted to explore that section and also cover the Alberta road trail. Meena and I head out this afternoon with the kids. While the trail was beautiful and the kids did have a real good time, I didn't quite feel great. With temps reaching 85+ and absolutely no breeze, I was so glad when we were done with the hike. Totally about 2.5 miles.

This section of the Thru trail also had quite a few options for kayaking and rock climbing. Will definitely get back here later to spend time near the water.
