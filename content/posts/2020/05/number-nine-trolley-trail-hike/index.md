title: Number Nine Trolley Trail Hike
year: 2020
---

This trail has been on my lists in the [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) app and for whatever reason, we haven't had a chance to explore it yet. Decided on a whim to head here this Sunday. By-far one of the best hikes in Baltimore!

The trail as such is a tarred path winding up Ellicot city with multiple streams on either side. We decided to veer off on one of the sub-trails (Red trail) for some quality time out in the woods. With a mild breeze and a looming cloud shower, Shasta slept through most of it. Definitely heading back here later with Appa!
