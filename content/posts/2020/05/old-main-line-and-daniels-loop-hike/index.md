title: Old Main line and Daniels' loop hike
year: 2020
---

Planned to hike the Alberta Road Thru trail but ended hiking the Old Main Line and Daniels' loop since that's where we found parking! Thanks to the Lock-down lift-off, the weekend and a terrific weather.

This turned out to be one of those random trail finds which I'll truly cherish. Beautiful trail views as you ascend onto old main line and drop back on the Daniels' section with the river on your left. Bright sunshine, gentle breeze and a good nippy climate absolutely made our day! Rounded out about 3 miles as we made our way back to the car.
