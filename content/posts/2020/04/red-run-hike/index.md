Nancy was itching for a run and we finally decided to take her outdoors. We hiked/ran about 2 miles starting out at Dolfield Blvd and into the woods instead of the regular paved section. I'd biked here last year so I was decently familiar with this section of the trail. Let her explore on her own as I trailed behind. We decided to turn around at the point where the trail leads on to the Soldier's delight Natural environmental area.

Crisp, bright weather! Shasta had a ball of time outdoors too. Her first outing in now almost two months post the Covid19 outbreak!
