Over the last few days, I've been meandering through [Bert](https://berthub.eu/index.html)'s webpage and a few other sites - Such a treasure trove of information on the C-19 vaccine and biology/technology in general. No seriously, dive into these links for some great layman(ish) explanation of DNA, RNA, Vaccines and what not!

- [Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine](https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3c8962f2a2.96282489)
- [No, Really, mRNA Vaccines Are Not Going To Affect Your DNA](https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea38322bb2a0.08041300)
- [The story of mRNA: From a loose idea to a tool that may help curb Covid](https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3d3bb2ac73.65468826)
- [I Made a Covid-19 Vaccine in my Kitchen and it Worked](https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3e5f534579.64795290)

Note: These links point to my [Wallabag instance](https://bag.srkn.org/). I'd much prefer linking to the original article. However, I find this as a good way to save information which I can access later even if the original source vanishes.
