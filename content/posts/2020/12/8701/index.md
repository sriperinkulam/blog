I am so glad I moved out of the Apple ecosystem a few years back. Was good while I was using it and now that I'm off, I don't really follow or have the urge to upgrade to the next in-thing. It is liberating and I guess - to each his own!

Absolutely love such 'meandering' posts! You never know what you're going to be reading in the next para and the heading can only do justice to a specific section.
