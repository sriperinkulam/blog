I recently had to turn on images in a particular e-mail to read a specific piece of content which I thought was interesting. It's alarming and rather obscene how images are used in certain newsletters to convey a simple wall of text. Thanks, no thanks - I'm unsubscribing right away!

And while we're on that topic, I've been using [postale.io](https://postale.io/) for about a couple months now and absolutely love it! Setting it up was a breeze and the web-front is refreshingly clean!
