Just found a nifty plugin that would map charts feeding off from gpx inputs. Here are the chart outputs from my recent Ragnar Run.

**Legs 01 - 06 \[4.9 mi + 2.7mi + 8.9mi\]**

 

\[sgpx gpx="/wp-content/uploads/gpx/activity\_602412715.gpx" \]

 

**Legs 13 - 18 \[5.8mi\]**

 

\[sgpx gpx="/wp-content/uploads/gpx/activity\_602412752.gpx" \]

 

**Legs 25 - 30 \[3.4mi\]**

 

\[sgpx gpx="/wp-content/uploads/gpx/activity\_602412773.gpx" \]

 

**Legs 31 - 36 \[2.4mi\]**

Was literally dead in this leg. Heat and uphills can be a deadly combination!
