Great weather, strong finish and yet another run that convinced me running on city roads isn't quite my thing. This most probably would be my last 'scheduled' run for 2014 and couldn't have asked for a finer closure of a crazy week. Another exciting family event adds further to this silver lining making this run even more memorable.

Mile 10 will be remembered and Philadelphia - we shall be back!
