Cleared the second Actuarial Exam today! Set the chopper as an incentive for me to pass some months back. Eventually grew out of it and was later gifted a fitbit by wifey. The chopper here was gifted by us to a roommate who'd cleared this exam earlier.

For some reason, this one exam took quite some effort to clear. Thrilled and am just not able to sleep. Here's to the flight on a dark crystal night!
